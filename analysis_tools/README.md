Language analysis tools, to transform programs in various languages into control-flow-graphs (CFGs) and perform analyses. Currently can find cyclomatic complexity.

Language Support:
- Mini-C
- C (mostly complete)

In Progress:
- Java

Yes, I know the C directory is currently really messy. I'm going to clean it up next week once I have C and Java working and can test everything.
